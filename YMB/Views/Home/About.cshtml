    <span style="font-size: 2em; padding-left: 25px;">A</span>s a homebrewer, working towards opening a craft brewery can be a daunting and inconceivable task at times. There are many factors that go into brewing beer, nevermind opening a business where the competition hasn't been this fierce for over a decade.
    Anyone that has ever been obssessed and consumed by a hobby can attest - "Hey I should do this for a living".

    That is exactly how I felt when I brewed my first beer in December 2013, it was an extract blonde ale kit that comes with those notorious starter kits. With a mere 5 hour brew day under my belt I can tell you -
    that was my first and last extract kit. I didn't know if my beer was good. Sure my friends said it was good and my parents "raved" about it but that's almost their job by nature to tell me so. What I did know was - I needed to distingush myself and "put my money where my mouth was". How does the "best" steak house become the best? Reputation.

    I began entering as many competitions as I could find.
